Bug: Playing Smithy does not draw correct number of cards
Status: Open

Description:  Whenever a player chooses to play Smithy card their hand count is not reflecting
the correct change.  In addition, their deck count is also not being decremented by three as
would be expected after drawing three cards.
How-to: Bug can be recreated by calling the cardEffect function with smithy as the first parameter.
The rest of the game state should not matter.


Bug: Playing Adventurer places incorrect cards into player hand.
Status: Open

Description: The cards being placed into the players hand upon using an adventurer card are not
consistently treasure cards.  ~80% of the time one of the cards placed into the player hand is
not copper, silver, or gold.
How-to: Call the cardEffect function with adventurer as the first parameter, and with the first cards
on the current player's deck not being treasure cards.  This should place non-treasure cards into the
player hand.


Bug:  Calling getWinners does not return the correct winners for a game
Status: Open

Description:  The getWinners function is currently returning incorrect information on which players
have a winning set of cards.  Certain variations of games will return the correct winner, but very few.
How-to:  While this error can be reached from multiple gameStates, simply setting one player alone to
have the only victory card in the game in their deck will properly recreate the bug.
